              <p> If you live or work outside the UK or you have a complaint concerning our activities outside the UK,
                you
                may prefer to lodge a complaint with a different supervisory authority. A list of relevant authorities
                in
                the EEA and the European Free Trade Area can be accessed here.</p>

              <h4 class="policy__item-2">Security</h4>
              <p>We have implemented measures designed to secure the information we collect and store about you and will
                use our reasonable efforts to protect your personal data from unauthorised disclosure and/or access
                including through the use of network and database security measures, but these cannot guarantee the
                security of any data which is collected and stored. We use encryption when collecting or transferring
                sensitive data, such as credit card information. The safety and security of your information also
                depends
                on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the
                EVOLVEBPM LLC websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to
                share your password with anyone.</p>
              <h4 class="policy__item-2">Other Websites</h4>
              <p>Please note that clicking on links and banner advertisements on our websites can result in your browser
                accessing a third-party website, where data privacy practices are different to that of EVOLVEBPM LLC.
              </p>
              <p>We are not responsible for, and have no control over, data that is submitted to or collected by these
                third parties, and if you have any questions about their privacy practices, you should consult their
                privacy policies.</p>

              <h4 class="policy__item-2">Internet-based Transfers</h4>
              <p>Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process personal
                data
                necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Unfortunately, the transmission
                of data via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we take commercially reasonable measures to
                protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our websites
                via
                third party networks. Any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your data, we will use
                strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
