              <h3>Internet-based Transfers</h3>

                protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our websites via
                third party networks. Any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your data, we will use
                strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
